# Skill: Concise Markdown Documentation

## Purpose

Produce documentation that is easy to scan, copy from, and follow without
additional context. Clarity takes priority over visual decoration.

## Core Principles

- Write for humans first, not for formatting tools
- Keep sentences short — one idea per sentence
- Prefer plain language over jargon
- Avoid redundancy
- Structure content so a reader can skim and still act correctly

## Formatting Rules

### Headings

Use headings to organize content, not to decorate it. Do not add a heading
for a section that contains only one or two sentences.

### Bold and Italics

Avoid unless the emphasis changes meaning. When in doubt, leave it out.

### Code Blocks

Every command gets its own fenced code block.

Correct:
```
curl https://example.com
```

Incorrect — inline code for commands:

Run `curl https://example.com` to fetch the page.

Incorrect — unrelated commands in one block:
```
curl https://example.com
sudo apt update
```

Exception: multiple commands are allowed in one block when they form a
single continuous flow (e.g., a pipeline or a setup sequence that must
run together).

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered items
- Keep each item to one line where possible
- Avoid nesting beyond two levels

### Tables

Avoid tables unless a comparison has three or more attributes and a list
would be harder to read. Prefer short sections or lists instead.

## Writing Style

- Neutral and instructional tone — no filler, no marketing language
- Define uncommon terms once, on first use
- Use consistent naming throughout — do not alternate between synonyms
- Break long explanations into numbered steps

## Command Documentation Pattern

1. One sentence describing what the command does
2. The command in its own code block
3. Optional: a single sentence explaining key flags or output

Example:

Fetch the client's public IP address:
```
curl http://canihazip.com
```

Returns the IP as plain text.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Use numbered steps for procedures
- Each step = one action
- Place the command immediately under the step it belongs to

Example:

1. Install the package.
```
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Start the service.
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

## What to Avoid

- Long paragraphs before showing a command
- Multiple ideas in one section
- Decorative markdown (horizontal rules for style, excessive bold)
- Redundant explanations that restate what the command already shows
- Deeply nested lists

## Output Checklist

Before finalizing, confirm:

- [ ] Commands are in isolated code blocks
- [ ] Each section has one clear purpose
- [ ] No unnecessary formatting is present
- [ ] The document can be followed without external context
- [ ] Content is easy to scan at a glance
